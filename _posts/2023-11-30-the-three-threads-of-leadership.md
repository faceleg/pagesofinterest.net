The idea one can only go to a line manager for all elements of leadership limits individual and organisational growth. Instead if we analyse the components of leadership, we can identify more appropriate ways to receive it.

Over the years I've come to understand there are roughly three key areas we need to be aware in if we are to ensure success, both in terms of individual and in terms of organisational success.

These are the "Three Threads of Leadership":

- Direction
  Mentorship
  Coaching

## Direction

This is the simplest concept: where do my work instructions come from? For an individual contributor on a technology team, this is the Product Owner. By way of whatever ceremonies you use, the Product Owner prepares a list of work, prioritises it and issues it to the team, who execute the work.

As one moves through the ranks this becomes somewhat less clear: consider the Principal Engineer. They may spend some time in a squad, executing work deemed too critical, difficult or experimental for the wider team. They also spend time with the craft to push this where we need to go. They may also spend time with upper management, ensuring vision and roadmaps are both ambitious enough and possible.

Advice: think about who gives you work direction and why.

## Mentorship

Somewhat complicated, as many assume this is also their boss. The reality is that mentorship is a very personal activity, both to the mentor and the mentee. It is an arrangement that should be entered into intentionally and with a goal - learn things the mentor has to teach, because they represent gaps in one's capability that hinder career movement.

This _may_ be your boss, but this will be due to luck. You may have more than one mentor, depending on where you want to go. I have a couple, each representing areas I need to improve in order to achieve my personal goals.

Advice: think about where you want to go. Look around you for someone who is there or obviously on their way. Foster a relationship and potentially explicitly ask them to mentor you in relevant areas. This person doesn't need to work in your team, department or even company. LinkedIn can help here.
