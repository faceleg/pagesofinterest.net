Before making changes, consider Chestertonâ€™s Fence: understand the reasons behind existing structures to avoid unintended consequences and potential regrets.

## Introduction

[Chesterton's Fence](https://www.chesterton.org/taking-a-fence-down/) is a principle that changes shouldn't be made until the context and reasons that caused whatever is to be changed to exist are understood, and therefore any second or third order consequences have been taken into account.

When faced with a problem to solve, it is natural for people to leap to the conclusion we should immediately embark on some change activity.

## A Leader's Role in Decision Making

As leaders we must become very good at incorporating a large amount of surface detail and making a call immediately. This is a useful skill and appropriate in some cases - however often doing so is harmful in the long run.

Leading across large organisations allows one to gather much context, options and advise disparate groups on a course of action.

It is therefore a leader's responsibility to be aware of the interrelations between various groups across the organisation, competing priorities and the strategic direction. Using this view point and thoughtful concepts like Chesterton's Fence we can help our teams step back and consider the impacts of different directions.

## Balancing Desires to Progress with Sticking to Strategy

It is common for influential and high performing team members to prioritise immediate action towards a goal - this is both healthy and necessary if the organisation is to succeed. These tendencies must be balanced to ensure all move in the same general direction - and to avoid tearing down perfectly reasonable and important "fences" as individual groups progress.

There are two key actions you can take as a leader to help teams avoid ignoring context and history while they forge a path successfully.

First, make sure your team understands where they're going - teams without a clear strategy cannot be expected to think of solutions that align with their peers and other business units. An excellent way to do this very quickly is by using the [Now, Next, Later Framework](/now-next-later-planning-streams-and-roadmaps).

Secondly, [writing an options paper](/what-is-an-options-paper) is an excellent and quick way for people to articulate first what they want to change, then work towards understanding the second and higher order implications of the change. Progressing within this structure results in an artifact you can use to frame questions, ensure strategic implications are covered and socialise it with your peers before deciding on the change itself.

## Speak About the Problem

In your all-hands meetings, one-to-ones and other sessions, make time to talk about these pitfalls in thinking. Talk about your strategy, how your peer business units show up and what they need. Acknowledge the humanity we share and that it's up to us all to hold each other to account.

Use analogies and examples aligned to your teams skill sets. For example, if explaining the impacts of Chesterton's Fence to a team of Software Engineers I would use the typical reaction of an engineer to a new or older codebase, which is invariable "the only option we have is to rewrite it from scratch". [This reaction, while natural is almost never a good idea](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) and a perfect way to stymie the organisation, fail and end up with *two* systems where before we simply had one, albeit suboptimal system. Challenge yourself to find examples in your team's area of expertise and challenge them to understand why stepping back to consider context & higher order consequences is so important.

There are many psychological biases or pitfalls we can fall victim to. Understanding them and frameworks to avoid being trapped is a critical skill for leaders to develop.
