Software Engineering is an interesting profession. There are no mandatory tools, no agreed handbook explaining minimum basic tenets to follow to ensure a long and healthy career. We're expected it seems, to figure it out ourselves. In this post I want to talk about a tool we take for granted that you'll notice only when the break: your hands.

It is assumed that as sedentary workers, we can't physically wear out. For me this lead to mistakes early on that nearly cost me my income.

Over my career as an individual contributor I worked through solutions until I settled where I am today. I coach my managers and talk about this topic whenever I'm triggered - it's important and can be the difference between being able to focus on what matters or struggling to work at all.

## The Issue

Numbness and pain, starting in the pinkies and developing upwards through the outside of my arms and into my shoulders and neck. Being young and relatively stupid in many ways, I ignored it assuming it would go away. It got worse.

## Solution Part #1: A New Virtual Input Method

I was a month away from starting a new job and efficient in my current work. I took this as an opportunity to change habits. I discovered Vim, and learned that it was designed to split reading and writing, a modal editor. The options it gives to minimise finger movement seemed ideal. The learning curve was steep!

It took about a week for me to get to 75% of my previous efficiency and another two to get close to 100%. I think I would have been much faster today, given the resources available:

- [Vim interactive tutorials, learn the basics]()
- [Preset Vim plugin collections](lazyvim)
- [Modern Vim implementation](neovim)

This alternative input method helped, but didn't fix the problem. It did give me a new joy - editing text with Vim. All Vim users will tell you it's worth learning! Most engineering oriented applications come with in built Vim commands or plugins that add them, including modern IDE's like VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA and others.

Do your brain a favour and learn Vim today.

## Solution Part #2: A New Physical Input Method

Months into my new job - responsible for technology within a small company. Doing my work and fixing any mistakes or omissions
