Conway's law is that teams will create products that reflect the structures of the organsiation they work within. Learn how to use this to your advantage.

[Melvin Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Conway) was a computer scientist who coined this law in 1967:

> Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

-- [Melvin Conway, 1967](https://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html)

This observation remains relevant today, but not solely to IT teams. I suggest it is releveant to us all, from strategy all the way down.

In my career I've seen failure to address organisational and structural issues contribute significantly to suboptimal performance, whether that manifests in failure in market, extreme inefficiency or in some cases failure for organisations to effectively address obvious customer demands despite having the resources and stated desire to do so.

## Is it IT specific?

Although coined and discussed mainly in the IT crowd, a wider understand and attention to this concept is necessary for organisations to transform successfully, especially older companies who have so far managed to ignore modern practices.

As IT workers must learn about the business their employer competes in, it behooves the busines to understand more of IT.

Conway's law is a general commentary on the effectiveness of taking into account appropriate changes to organsiational structure as part of seeking transformation. One cannot simply adopt and fund a transformative strategy and expect the organisation that was to execute it. If we could, we wouldn't need transformation!

## Why does this law matter?

In large organisations, strategy, direction and funding comes from the top. Each major function feeds into the strategy, which is signed off by the CEO/Board. Funding is allocated based on ongoing costs of business and what is needed and available to contribute to moving the strategy forward. The money flows down to the workers roughly along reporting lines. Each major function and their directors are given responsibility to execute their part of the strategy and incentivised to be successful. This trend continues down the line.

A poorly structured organisation will compete with itself, fighting to solve problems presented at each level, potentially ignoring what the customer needs and the purpose of the original strategy. This alone is not ideal - coupled with higher levels of attrition (staff aren't stupid) and a competitive environment, Conway's law becomes an important tool in the box.

## How to combine it with business vision

A business embarks on a transformation journey when they've been shocked into understanding how badly they're setup to succeed in a market changed from their heyday. It is not something taken lightly and difficult to pull off successfully.

Changes to the way departments are structured and how they are expected to cooperate should be baked into a strategy. Instead of "We will win by building X", think: "We will win by becoming Y in order to build X".
