Organisations succeed or fail on the strength of internal communication. Many technology managers of us have the tendency to dive in too deep when responding to questions. Learn how to learn new ways to think about and respond to questions in a corporate environment.

## Introduction

The wider an area one is responsible for, the more one will be called on to provide updates, answer questions and generally represent varied work. These questions come from peers and the layers above.

We who were previously engineers are often not good at responding to these questions. Depending on the circumstances and who is asking it is common for explanations to devolve into discussion of minute details, burying the answer in a sea of irrelevant or confusing technicalities, often missing the point entirely.

This doesn't feel good as the responder. It can cause the requester to be frustrated, waste time with clarifying questions and reduce the chances they'll come to you with these questions next time.

This is not good for career advancement; it does not help the organisation win.

## Why do we do this: the happy place

Diving deep into a subject and exploring every angle was the secret to success when dealing with technical problems. It is often the "happy place" we return to when uncertain or stressed or under time pressure.

This is more common in junior managers. Senior managers suffer from this flaw at times of stress and uncertainty.

Stop now and consider what you enjoyed most about solving technical problems, and whether this behaviour is useful when working to engage with peers or leadership when asked for explanations or context.

## A strategy to improve

Identifying maladaptive behaviours is the first and most difficult step to becoming better - if you've just reached this milestone: congratulations! The rest is fairly easy, though time consuming.

I've approached retraining myself to respond more usefully in situations where I'm liable to fall back into my deep-dive happy place by creating a structured approach I can force myself to follow. Eventually it'll become second-nature.

Put simply, loop through these actions: Read, Think, Write, Review, Repeat, Send.

### Read

Carefully and with focus, read the request. Don't press reply, start thinking about their question.

### Think

Depending on the combination of seniority, surrounding context and potential outcomes of the answer you'll want to spend anywhere from a few minutes to much longer on this step. Knee-jerk responses to high level management entail a level of risk that is seldom worth taking.

Think about the request from the perspective of the one asking.

- What context do they have or lack that might be relevant?
- Is there anything between the words you might have missed?

The less context someone has, the more possible answers might exist for their questions. In these cases it can be possible to reply succinctly to a rather vague question after considering the related context surrounding the person asking.

- What are the drivers behind this question?
- Why are they asking about this *now*?

Has something happened recently (e.g. an outage, a particularly fiery review meeting) that may have triggered this question? How might this influence the response they expect?

### Write

Draft a response. Less words is better.

### Review

Read the question again. Read your response:

- Have you answered the question?
- Have you included anything extraneous?
- Have you included context where relevant?

Nobody likes to read 10 pages where a paragraph will do. Make sure you've been parsimonious with your words. Paradoxically, nobody likes to have to ask 10 clarifying questions. There is a balance, try to find it.

### Repeat, Send

If you're not 80-90% confident you've answered it well, start the process again. If you are, or you've run out of time, send off your response.

When really stuck, ask your colleagues or manager for advice. It's our job to help each other out in these situations.

Keep an ear out for any reactions or responses. use this information to inform changes in your approach.

Realise even the most well formed reply may result in follow up questions - these aren't inherently bad. What we want to avoid are follow up questions that could have been avoided by a more appropriate message.

## Principal of simplicity

Communication is hard and large organisations are complicated. Keep your communication simple, ot the point and unambiguous. Craft your reply to suit the audience and be ready to field follow ups. Each interaction is an opportunity to help push the organisation forward, keep this in mind and put the appropriate amount of thought into your words.
