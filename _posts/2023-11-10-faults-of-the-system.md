# Faults of the System

A key element of Deming's teaching is that it is management, not the contributor who is accountable for ensuring the
environment allows for quality output. He's not saying contributors have not responsibility or that they shouldn't try,
            in fact that everyone is "trying their best" is a key assumption (see [Deming's 14 Points](/deming-14-points/)).

Instead Deming is teaching that if a contributor of a group of contributors aren't improving beyond a certain point,
        there is a process or environmental factor in the way. It is management's job to identify these processes or
        environmental issues and remove them.

These factors are what Deming describes here as "Faults of the System":

> One feature, especially applicable to production, is techniques by which to distinguish between (a) special causes of variation of quality and economic loss, which the worker himself can correct on statistical signal, and (b) faults of the system, which only management can correct.
