We're all familiar with debt. Workers in IT understand tech debt. Recognising "organisational debt" and how to pay it back is important if leaders want to succeed in their mission.

Organisational debt is a limit to success. Money, people and other resources can support growth despite it but true and fundamental success is impossible without addressing it.

## What is organisational debt?

It is the shape of the organisation and how well or poorly this shape supports the goals of leadership. Very similar to [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) in many respects. As with tech debt, organisational debt will can be easy to ignore (things were always this way) and difficult to correct.

Organisational debt is pernicious, building up over time.

## What causes organisational debt?

It is common for companies to shift priorities. Sometimes this happens gradually, sometimes all at once. In either case, organisational debt builds up every time we change our priority without reviewing and possibly changing how the company is organised. Here is a rather contrived example showing how it can build up:

> Consider a small, profitable SaaS company with a CEO, a CTO, CPO and four 6-person engineering teams. They have a WordPress marketing website managed by an external vendor and their main product. Teams have no issue releasing features at a good pace, dealing with maintenance and customer issues in a timely manner.
>
> External factors have made finances tight, the CEO directs the team to save money. They in-source management of the marketing site, giving it to one of the internal teams. This splits focus for the team but they absorb it and carry on with feature work mostly as before, with some slowdown.
>
> A few quarters roll by. During this time the CPO identifies a potentially lucrative new segment. The executives discuss and agree to pursue it. They secure some investment and hire 6 more people into a 5th team. Two teams work on the new segment, with the remaining 3 on their original backlog of work. The teams working on features for the new segment are encouraged to work fast and cut corners if it might help them hit market earlier.
>
> Development progresses well and feature are released. Unfortunately the new segment doesn't turn out to be as profitable as expected, so the CEO asks their team to cut costs again. This results in a restructure that removes headcount, reducing each team by 1 person. The new features are either merged into the main product or removed.
>
> Leadership is dismayed to find work is now slower. Corners cut turn out to be creating higher maintenance burden, merging features into the main product was done quickly by people who were not familiar with the code (those who wrote it left with the restructure). Teams face uncomfortable decisions on where to focus: features, maintenance or issue management, stretched too thin and unable to achieve progress on all three.

What started out as an efficient company able to push out features, deal with maintenance work and customer issues became one unable to attend to this work effectively while being more expensive, without generating significantly more revenue. None of the decisions made were obviously _wrong_, but the result was negative.

Making decisions and moving quickly is important, but failing to take a holistic view of the impact of these actions over time, compounds on one another is detrimental and creates Organisational Debt.

What causes Organisational Debt? Actions compounded on each other over time pausing to consider the current state.

There is a simple checklist one can work through to identify how well or poorly an organisation is doing regarding Organisational Debt:

1. What is our strategy, has it changed?
2. What is our capability, is it relevant to our current strategy?
3. How are we structured, and does that structure most support success?
4. What can we stop doing?
5. What should we start doing?

## How can one remediate Organisational Debt?

As the aggregate effect of incremental change, when Organisational Debt becomes obvious, the fix will be difficult and disruptive. If the company's strategy has changed and available capability is insufficient (both in terms of technical and human capability, e.g. our systems and our people), then it is likely the structure is not optimal and there may be many things currently being done that should stop, and things not being done that should be started.

When things get into this state we start hearing talk of "Transformation", which is usually entails much work aimed to remediate the issues mentioned above. Rhetoric around transformation takes roughly the following shape:

1. This is our new strategy
2. This is how we will reshape our systems to support successful execution of our strategy
3. This is how we will reshape our workforce
4. These are the things we will stop
5. This is what we'll start

Whether a company succeeds in transformation will depend on how well leadership understands Organisational Debt, if they have the support and tenacity to see the work required to resolve it through and of course, whether the new strategy is any good.

Transformation is about the most difficult exercise for an organisation, the larger the company the harder it will be. Knowing _why_ things are the way they are and considering _how they should be shaped in the future_ are critical.

Finally, when working on how to reshape your organisation for success remember that organisational structure is never perfect and always messy - think of restructures as rearranging the mess in a way more appropriate to supporting current goals, not as something that can be made perfect. Then: keep an eye on it.
