Organisational debt is a limit to success. Money, people and other fuel can support growth despite it but true and fundamental success is impossible without addressing it.

It is the shape of the organisation and how well or poorly this shape supports the goals of leadership

It can only be remediated through restructures which are difficult and impose their own drag

Compare it to financial and technical debt.

Organisational structure is never perfect and always messy - think of restructures as rearranging the mess in a way more appropriate to supporting our current goals

Keep an eye on it.
