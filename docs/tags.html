This is because up to a certain point, promotions and job offers come from technical skills alone. Ignoring this will limit opportunities to progress, as you will have to work much harder to prove possession of skills &amp; attributes required to advance. It took me a long time to get comfortable with how to ask for LinkedIn recommendations. I\u2019ve summarised my approach here. If you follow the advice in this post, you will build up an online history of your progress that will be a goldmine for prospective employers. As you progress into management and leadership LinkedIn recommendations will provide another level of value. Candidates for open positions on your team will read these recommendations and may choose to join your team based on what others have written. Don\u2019t make assumptions: Before developing this approach for asking for &amp; giving linked in recommendations I tended to avoid thinking about them. I would ignore them or think negatively and actively avoid requesting/giving recommendations These are the main assumptions I\u2019ve made:  I was asking too much from others by requesting a recommendation That I wasn\u2019t significant enough in their eyes to warrant the time required to write a recommendation I knew I would have to give them a recommendation in return but feared \u201cblank page\u201d syndrome and that I wouldn\u2019t know what to writeThese are all wrong. Here is the reality of each point:  If I enjoyed working for or with someone, they probably did too, and likely want to see me succeed. Writing a LinkedIn recommendation is a small way for them to make another contribution to success This is typical imposter syndrome. I just had to ignore this and request anyway.  This is the main point of this article! read on to learn how to frame your requests efficiently and help your recommender out. How to make it easier for your recommender: Unless the recommender has their own process, they\u2019re likely to procrastinate due to the blank page effect. Help them out by framing your ideal recommendation. I do this by giving them a template like this example:  I\u2019m keen on honest feedback, but I know it can be hard to think of what to write. \xa0  To make it less painful, you might pick one or more of the points below and write some words around how I may have performed?  - Leadership - Proactive, creative and metric based approach to enhancing performance of people and resolving issues  - Wide impact - decisions, advice and actions are impactful across the whole organisation\xa0  - Empathy - Championing fairness and equality - removing bias, encouraging open and fair communication  - Supportive of autonomy - did I let you approach problem solving in your own way? \xa0  - Air-support - did I help in any way if/when people came in from the side to interfere with your project or daily work?  \u2026 anything you\u2019d like to be highlighted Providing this framework gives your recommender an easy \u201cjumping off point\u201d. Together with the right way of asking I\u2019ve had great results here. People tend to turn their recommendations around within hours or days, previously it would take significantly longer. How to make it easier for you to return the favour: This one is really easy - just suggest they read this article! How to ask for LinkedIn recommendations: Although you can simply request directly through LinkedIn, I like to ask \u201coffline\u201d first, to confirm the person is happy to help me out in this way. This means I either ask in person or in some form of instant message application before sending the \u201cformal\u201d LinkedIn request. Here\u2019s an example message you might use to request a recommendation from a boss or boss-adjacent colleague:  Hi! I really enjoyed working on your team, and I feel I learned so much from you. If you\u2019re willing, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you wrote a LinkedIn recommendation for me.  All good if you\u2019re too busy - just let me know! Of course I\u2019d love to return the favour and write one for you too :) What to do next: Think of the people you\u2019ve worked with in the past:  Those you learned most from Those you think you helped the most Or those you most respectedBite the bullet and send that request - they\u2019ll be happy to hear from you &amp; more than willing to help you out with your first LinkedIn recommendation! "},{id:7,url:"/mvp-a-b-testing/",title:"MVP A/B Testing",body:"2021/03/04 - Does the sign up button work better on the left or the right? What happens to engagement if we move our \u201cyou might also like\u201d carousel above the fold? These are the types of questions that A/B testing exists to answer. A/B testing is the best way to empirically prove whether a change has the desired effect  Sure you might need an expensive solution, but if you\u2019re not doing either today, an MVP approach will let you get something into production quickly to prove the value to business, before diving into the excellent, but expensive, SaaS products out there. From the least-funded startup all the way to the biggest banks, product owners and leadership are waking up to the idea that the best decisions are made based on good data. They read sites like the Harvard Business Review, they learn about things like A/B (or split) testing, they demand to know why your engineering &amp; product teams are not doing it. What isn\u2019t widely known is that like most other aspects of good product design &amp; delivery, A/B testing doesn\u2019t sit with engineering alone. It isn\u2019t enough to simply pay for a tool - the entire process of delivery has to be changed to accomodate it, else the tool will be a complete waste of money. Years ago, when I was involved in evaluating and implementing an A/B test solution, I was asked first to find the best tool and for the price. I did my research and came back with some figures. Too expensive, especially for a tool that we\u2019ve no experience with and whose value we cannot quantify. Enter Open Source: SixPack: Determined to give the business a chance to evaluate A/B testing, I canvassed the open source community to see if there was an MVP solution we could get started with. I found Sixpack, which is best described by the authors themselves:  Sixpack is a framework to enable A/B testing across multiple programming languages. It does this by exposing a simple API for client libraries. Client libraries can be written in virtually any language.  Sixpack has two main parts. The first,\xa0Sixpack-server, is responsible for responding to web requests. The second,\xa0Sixpack-web, is a web dashboard for tracking and acting on your A/B tests. Sixpack-web is optional.  github. com/sixpack/sixpack There are other options out there, sixpack was the easiest for our team to get going, and worked very well for us in the years following. After we made the tool available, it took many months for the wider team to adopt it and run tests with any regularity. As mentioned above, A/B testing is a new concept for many people, and it takes time for the wider team to understand how to use it appropriately and how to make decisions from the results (statistics is hard). Sixpack offers the basic features required to get an organisation started with A/B testing. My approach was  Install sixpack and integrate it to the point where experiments can be run Work with the wider team to prove/disprove the value of A/B testing itself Evaluate our needs against the features provided by sixpack, and be ready to raise my hand if we started outgrowing the toolA/B Testing and Rolls Royce: Our experience with sixpack was excellent. It provided all the features we needed, and cost nothing more than the hosting infrastructure it ran on. Maintenance was negligible. Although it did prove the value of A/B testing for the business, we never outgrew it. This saved the business 60-100K USD per year, while still allowing us to run experiments and effectively evaluate their results. If your business is new to A/B testing and data driven decision making generally, if you have a relatively small team and no core \u201cplatforms\u201d group you can look to for this sort of tooling, I strongly recommend you consider an open source solution first, before diving into the attractive but expensive SaaS products out there. If you need to get from A to B but don\u2019t enjoy wasting money, go with a proven open source solution before splashing your company\u2019s cash on a Rolls Royce. You\u2019re likely better off putting that money elsewhere - it\u2019s enough to hire another engineer for your team! : "},{id:8,url:"/how-to-be-effective-in-video-meetings/",title:"How to Be Effective in Video Meetings",body:"2021/02/28 - Remote Communication Takes Work - But It\u2019s Worth It: Compared to what we\u2019re used to - face to face - remote communication may not feel as natural or easy at first. It can be very difficult to learn how to be effective in video meetings. If you put effort in and learn some of the following strategies, you\u2019ll be meeting, chatting and innovating as naturally online as you\u2019re accustomed to when in person. We can all be as efficient or better from home as we are in the office! Following are some tips and tools to help you get there. When Should I Use Instant Text Messaging, Voice or Video?: When to Instant Message (IM): if you\u2019re asking for something simple that can be communicated very clearly  Caution: people will likely not be \u201cchatty\u201d with instant messaging, as they will quickly switch from what they were doing to your message, fire of the minimal reply, then switch back to their work Advantage: this medium is great if you want to ask something without requiring them to reply immediatelyWhen to Call (Online Voice or Cellphone): if you\u2019re asking for something that is difficult to explain or understand, or when you want to leave room for free discussion. This is the equivalent of walking over to someone\u2019s desk - what you have to discuss is important enough to interrupt them but not formal enough for a calendar appointment.  Caution: this will interrupt people\u2019s flow Advantage: this medium is great if you want to leave room for free discussion, which is important when you may not know exactly what result you want, or you feel both parties need to contribute equally towards a solution Advantage: compared to instant messaging, you have voice tones, pauses and emphasis to work with. The more data we bring to our communications, the more human our interactions. Human interactions are important to foster community and innovationWhen to Video Call (Teams/Zoom/Google Meet - any Video): if you would have normally setup a face to face meeting - one to one\u2019s, group discussions, stand-ups, post incident reviews, coffee chats and presentations are some examples. A video meeting is the equivalent of holding a face to face meeting. You can schedule them in advance (e. g. team stand-ups), or on an ad-hoc basis (e. g. if during a group IM it becomes clear more focus is required, or if during a call it\u2019s clear being able to share documents etc is valuable).  Caution: if calling an ad-hoc meeting, give people 5-10 minutes to allow them to ensure they\u2019re in their \u201cvideo space\u201d Advantage: this is the best way to interact remotely, and with practise is as good (or better!) as face to face meetings Advantage: can share screens and engage in shared white boarding sessionsBasic Video Meeting Behavioural Etiquette: One person per computer/device If you\u2019re participating in a remote meeting, make sure you do so from your own device. Sharing devices makes it harder for collaborators to hear and understand non verbal queues. Use a headset (headphones with microphone), not your laptop for audio This will allow you to hear everything people say the first time, and allow them to hear what you say no matter how far you may sit from your laptop screen or fixed microphone. You also won\u2019t need to shout, which everyone around you will appreciate. Turn on your video! Don\u2019t be shy - we\u2019re used to looking at your face at work, it did OK there, it\u2019ll do great in video meetings too. Switching video on adds an entire new level of information to a meeting - we can read facial expressions, predict when it might be a good time to interject and generally get much more out of a meeting. You might not know - but in Teams video conferences, you can\xa0tell Teams to blur out your background! This works great when you may have a lot going on in the background, or if you\u2019re joining a call from say, a bedroom or a messy lounge. Most other video chat programs offer this - just google it, e. g. \u201cZoom blur background\u201d.  Blur your background in Teams video calls Blur your backgrounds in Zoom video callsDon\u2019t be shy - you bring your whole self to work, bring your whole self to video meetings too :) Mute yourself when you\u2019re not talking Whether using a headset or your laptop audio, it is likely your mic will pickup background noise (typing, mouth noises, children in the background). This can be very distracting for the speaker, they may interpret some noises as an attempt to interject. It is distracting for the listeners who will be trying to focus on the speaker. Mute yourself if you\u2019re not talking - use non verbal ways to indicate you\u2019re following along. Use non verbal cues consciously Eyebrows! Nodding your head! Hand movements! All of these are normal in your face to face interactions - make them normal on video too. During a stand up, when each person speaks for a minute or two, indicate agreement or otherwise with your hands or head. Physically raising your hand then talking is far more effective than just interrupting with a stone-face, as is agreeing by issuing a thumbs up vs breaking the speaker\u2019s flow with a \u201cYes\u201d. As the speaker, practise speaking more slowly, watching your audience and pausing after each sentence as a way to allow others to interject, voice/indicate agreement and generally participate. Share your screen to share your context If you\u2019re talking about a document, spreadsheet or pretty much anything else you can see on your computer scree, then Teams can let you share it with those on your video calls. Again - to discover screen sharing options available with your video calling solution, have a poke around in google.  Share your screen in TeamsYou can share much more than just your screen in Teams - including system audio, sharing control and more!

Great news for all of us - we can continue doodling in groups, online! Teams has the ability to add whiteboards to some meetings  Use Whiteboard in Microsoft TeamsWhiteboard integration in Microsoft Teams meetings is powered by Whiteboard for the web, which lets participants of Teams meetings draw, sketch, and write together on a shared digital canvas. Alternative online whiteboard options There are many, many alternatives when it comes to white boarding - including simply doodling on a piece of paper and sharing a photo! Zapier (a remote-first company) has compiled a great list of these apps:  11 Best Online Whiteboards for Team CollaborationBe Open!: We\u2019re in a very difficult time in our history. Getting things done over video instead of in-person is one of the side-effects. Be open and be kind with your colleagues - we\u2019ll get through this! "},{id:9,url:"/there-is-no-software-engineering-skill-shortage/",title:"There Is No Software Engineering Skill Shortage",
body:"2019/11/06 - It\u2019s just that we\u2019re doing hiring wrong: When attending meetups, particularly the manager-heavy kind, the current \u201cskills shortage\u201d in our industry often comes up. At a recent discussion session the organiser tabled this very topic - first asserting there is a skill shortage, then challenging the room to discuss how to resolve it. Of course I had to blurt out: \u201cThere is no skill shortage: we\u2019ve just been doing it wrong!\u201d Fewer things are more effective at exacerbating imposter syndrome than being the focus of a room full of high level technology managers in a fancy restaurant, at a session organised by a Silicon Valley giant. As impulsive as my statement was in the moment, this is a topic I feel strongly about. I believe that if one hires according to the accepted norms in our industry, then it may certainly appear there is a skills shortage - the statement rings true. It is also true that the standard hiring practises also result in homogenous teams that fail to represent, and therefore serve, the customer base they create solutions for. I propose that not only is there no skill shortage in technology, there is an abundance of people willing to join our teams. We\u2019ve just got to stop limiting ourselves to the standard candidate pool, take ownership of our culture, and create the demand that pulls people into our field. What we\u2019re doing wrong (and how to fix it): Whoever you are, wherever you work - whatever shape your team is: you\u2019re doing great! I mean, you care enough to bother reading about how to improve, right? This is long and when read in one go it paints a pretty sad picture of our industry. Our industry is sad, and we who are in positions to change it should feel bad. I agree it\u2019s hard. But we can fix it. The alternative is to do nothing, which I won\u2019t tolerate. These organisational, behavioural and cultural issues can be fixed in the same way we fix bugs - by focusing on the cause and changing our process until the bug no longer recurs. What follows is a list of the most common problems I\u2019ve seen or discussed, with easy to follow pathways for you to follow if you want to fix them in your organisation.  Using qualifications as predictors of future performance A clone army is inflexible and prone to bias No clear process for addressing gender imbalance in applicants Hiring processes often require unrealistic amounts of time from applicants Belief that seniority can be inferred by years on the job Practise interview techniques that highlight skills that are difficult to teach Understand that different genders and cultures view their position in hierarchy differentlyUsing qualifications as predictors of future performance: Don\u2019t turn people away at the gate: Problem: If your job advertisements mention a degree as being a requirement for applying for a role or you list extensive responsibilities, you\u2019ve immediately alienated a large pool of candidates. Background: I\u2019ve been successfully converting code into money for over 12 years. I have a degree, sure: in Social Studies. Although I did take programming papers, I\u2019ve never used anything I learned in those classes on any projects except for knowledge of basic syntax. On the team at Lightbox NZ, we had four engineers who either did not attend university or studied completely different subjects. Two of them transitioned from manual testers to automation engineering in a matter of weeks. They completed online course, then paired with their teammates. The other two came into engineering positions fresh from the Enspiral Dev Academy - having completed an 18 week bootcamp. All of them contributed at least equally to the business compared to their university trained colleagues. There is a confidence gap between men and women, and between cultures. When hiring, this gap will manifest itself in fewer applicants from women and other cultures when advertisements explicitly state required qualifications or include long lists of responsibilities. Solution: Do not mention qualifications or lists of responsibilities in your job advert. Universities do not have a monopoly on the teaching of software engineering skills. Applicants will tell you why they think they are qualified - this is the main function of a CV. Research shows that men will apply for jobs when they feel they achieve 60% of the qualifications or responsibilities. Women may not apply until they feel they achieve 100%. On reflection, this is what I do. To me, lists of responsibilities and even required qualifications are \u201cnice to haves\u201d. If I think I can do the job, I\u2019ll apply. It works for men, and as a side note - it can work for women too. But please, don\u2019t expect women to lean in: change your process to include them. Commitment to culture is commitment to people, and that takes time. Understand this and allocate sufficient time to do a first pass of candidates that takes into account all the qualifiers people put into their CV. The best engineers love learning - some love it so much they taught themselves to code and therefore never needed to attend classes. Some attended bootcamps. Some (like me) didn\u2019t know a career in programming was possible until their early 20\u2019s, and thought university was the only way to learn. Programming is becoming a commodity skill, complemented by people skills, background experience, and a personality. Requiring a degree or including extensive lists of responsibilities will limit your application pool. A clone army is inflexible and prone to bias: Be careful of subtle biases in your hiring material: Preamble: Research shows there are significant advantages to be gained by having a diverse and inclusive team. Topics in this section have been written about extensively, including articles in Forbes, Gartner and the Harvard Business Review: diverse teams doing the right thing most of the time, generally perform better than monocultures and how to disrupt bias on your existing teams. I\u2019d like to focus on how you can change your hiring process to cut off the source of clones. This will increase your pipeline of diverse candidates, enabling you to build out and maintain a diverse and inclusive team. Problem: Your job ad and hiring process are designed to hire people who look and think like you. Background: This is a tough pill to swallow. I thought I had done everything possible to ensure my job advert was as attractive as possible to all candidates. I was committed to creating a diverse and effective team. I\u2019d consulted people in my community of different gender and cultural backgrounds from me on my advert content. I passed it through the gender decoder &amp; Joblint tool. Only 2 of the 60 or so qualified applicants were women, and only 15 of the remaining 58 were not caucasian males. Something was obviously wrong. The issue was no longer with the advert itself, but with what happened next: the process through which an applicant registers interest was hilariously broken. Turns out the software we used to manage the hiring process had been configured with a bunch of default options, which were frankly horrible. Instead of being asked for general identifying details and a CV, the candidates were requested to:  Upload a cover letter Upload a photo Phone a robot and leave a voicemail introducing themselvesA cover letter I can understand - but I don\u2019t care to read them: an applicant\u2019s CV should be enough to decide whether to have a quick chat on the phone. I know from experience that writing a cover letter for each job application is draining and time consuming torture that I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone. Upload a photo? This was a surprising one. I mean - this wasn\u2019t the first time I had hired for this team, where else did I think the photos were coming from? I had assumed there was some clever programming going on, with the system pulling them from LinkedIn. Nope, the applicants were required to upload a photo. For a programming job. Phone a robot? Leave a message?! I can\u2019t even. The process of discovering this was rather embarrassing for me and uncomfortable for the person who brought it up. I had the CV from a wonderful applicant given to me and needed her to apply online in order to proceed. She took longer than I expected to do this, so I reached out and asked if everything was OK. After learning the above I immediately apologised and spent the next two hours figuring out how to remove everything but the bare essentials from the application form. This dramatically increased the diversity of applicants. Solution: Take an MVP approach to your application form. After posting a job advert, use incognito mode to go through the process of applying. If there are any steps that could be postponed until you\u2019ve had a chance to view a CV, remove them. You should ask only for the bare minimum: name, phone number, email, availability &amp; CV. Don\u2019t ask for anything that is not necessary for you to decide whether to do that first phone call. Make sure your application form does not ask for salary requirements or a cover letter. Request nothing but the bare minimum. No clear process for addressing gender imbalance in applicants: Also known as the \u201cbut no women apply\u201d problem: Problem: For any given technical job advertisement, 5% women applicants is considered winning. Background: You know diverse teams benefit the business, the health of our field, and society on the whole. You\u2019ve removed all the unconscious bias from your process. But still, 95% of the applicants coming through are male. Solution: Switch from passive to active recruitment. An amazing way to kick this off is to pick an arbitrary point in your hiring process, and require hiring managers to collect a 50/50 mix of male/female CV\u2019s before allowing the process to proceed past this point. This will force yourself and your hiring managers to be less passive about collecting suitable applicants. When I started doing this I found I started having much more direct conversations with recruitment companies. I started to understand which recruiters were able to change their process, and which weren\u2019t. This lead to me reaching deeper into my network for specific leads. Ultimately I was forced to form a deeper understanding of the issues facing our industry, and develop the alternative processes I\u2019m documenting here. I cannot take credit for this critical suggestion. That honour belongs to Amanda Santos, who presented at length on this topic in the 2018 SparkONE Unconference. Hiring processes often require unrealistic amounts of time from applicants: Only people with heaps of free time are eligible to work on my team: Problem: Many companies \u201cvalidate\u201d technical abilities of applicants by requiring them to perform a take home test that attempts to simulate a real-world problem. Said test is then handed in and evaluated by team members who rate it on some opaque marking criteria. Applicants who do not score well on these tests are not considered further. Background: Hiring people is scary. There is huge room for error, and the consequences have a large impact on teams - positive for great candidates and negative for poor candidates. It is important to evaluate the technical competence of applicants, but this task itself is wide open for abuse that will ostracise the otherwise great people who may apply for a given job. Consider the applicant\u2019s perspective: they want a new job. In order to do so they must apply for available positions. There are 10 positions available at their preferred location that appear to meet their criteria. If each position requires candidates to complete a take home test that was intended to take 4-8 hours to complete, the applicant is looking at an additional workload of 40-80 hours on top of their current job. It is hopefully obvious that this is unrealistic even for a single person who works 40 hours a week, has no hobbies or personal responsibilities that require significant time. In this \u201cideal\u201d scenario, the person is able to put in 2-4 hours a night after work, up to 16 hours a weekend. This person will be able to apply for 2-3 jobs per week. It would take them up to one month to apply for all 10 jobs. Consider the demographic this fits, and compare this to the majority demographic applying for your positions. Now consider reality for most of the rest of us: we work 40-60 hours a week, have a spouse to share housework with, have children we are responsible for. Maybe we also have ageing relatives to care for. Also we could just be old and jaded and unwilling to burn ourselves out just to jump through recruitment hoops. We can apply for up to 1-2 jobs per month on the outside, more likely we\u2019d be unable to properly service one application that required a take home assignment per month. Consider the demographic this fits, and again compare it to what you see in the demographics applying for your positions. Broadly, these tests function to eliminate women and single parents from the hiring pool and disempower career changers. Solution: Get creative and flexible with how you validate a candidate\u2019s ability. Some candidates may have an amazing GitHub profile. Many may have creative and technically interesting portfolio websites. Some might have nothing. You should consider how you might use what candidates can offer to validate their stated skills and experience against your requirements, and have plan on how to quickly and fairly assess those who are unable to provide anything. This solution hinges on the understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to evaluating technical skill. Like any dogmatic approach, fixating on one metric will cause you to miss out on many candidates.  There are plenty of reasons an excellent developer may not have a GitHub profile There are plenty who are unable or unwilling to commit significant time outside their job and other responsibilities to complete tests It\u2019s common for people to have nothing immediately availableIn order to fix this aspect of the hiring process, we should force ourselves to consider multiple ways to validate skills, and be ready to apply whatever is appropriate on an individual candidate basis. I like David Gilbertson\u2019s take on this topic, and recommend you read his article: How to hire the best developers. Excellent exploration of the failings of \u201ctesting culture\u201d, with solid advice on how to avoid losing out on great candidates while effectively screening poor ones. Being a manager means managing people. Hiring the best people requires real work and must be approached with the same care and rigour we apply to resolving the most troublesome bugs. Belief that seniority can be inferred by years on the job: Doing things wrong for ten years is not better than doing it right for two: Problem: Many people blindly assume that there is a correlation between the number of years one has been in a field and their seniority in said field. Background: I used to hold this assumption, and when posting jobs for seniors I would include something like \u201cMust have W years experience in X &amp; Y, overall must have been in technology as a programmer for Z years\u201d. I held this assumption until I hired someone who was, on paper, very senior. Their on-the-job skills failed to live up to expectations, they left, and I had to rescue their projects over many late nights. This caused me to carefully reconsider what I mean when I say \u201csenior\u201d. Instead, seniority needs to be categorised according to measurable traits and skills, for example:  Entry level engineer     Can complete only trivial tasks without significant help   Has shallow understanding of at least one complete area of the team\u2019s software   Is learning how to take ownership of self-learning   Actively seeks out mentorship in the technical space    Intermediate level engineer     Can complete middling and higher complexity tasks without significant help   Has deep understanding of at least one complete area of the team\u2019s software   Has mastered self-learning and looks for opportunities to expand their knowledge   Maintains mentorship relationships in the technical space, has started mentoring less senior members, actively seeks mentorship in the interpersonal space    Senior level engineer     Can complete tasks of any complexity level   Has deep understanding of most areas of the team\u2019s software   Seeks out opportunities to increase knowledge and understanding across the team   Actively mentors members of the team at all levels   Notice there is no mention of time on the job. I\u2019ve had team members who have been in software engineering for less than two years meet requirements for the top intermediate level. Then there is the person who, despite many years in the industry, could barely be categorised as entry level by the above descriptions. The above categories are a very diluted version of a much more comprehensive document I\u2019ve been working on for years - inspired by the CircleCi Engineering Competency Matrix. I\u2019ll blog about my interpretation of this concept in a future post. Solution: Seniority, expressed in years on the job is not a good hiring metric. Seniority has little to do with technical ability. Do some research and decide yourself what seniority means for your team. Don\u2019t blindly assume that anyone with a good number of years on the job will meet your requirements. Learning the hard way hurts. Practise interview techniques that highlight skills that are difficult to teach: Favour methods that expose flexibility, teamwork and willingness to deal with change: Problem: Common interview dogma is that we should focus on proving a candidate can perform technical tasks adequately well. This is wrong as we are not robots that are easily interchangeable, and technical skills can be taught quickly to the right people. Background:As outlined above, technical testing interview culture does nobody any favours. Instead we should focus on proving the candidate:  Can learn Can deal with change Is flexible Can take feedback well Works well with a diverse range of peopleBeing able to learn is important, and ties in well with dealing with change. Over the course of my engineering career I\u2019ve gone from JavaScript to PHP/MySQL, back to JavaScript with probably 5-10 different frameworks, then Java, then Node, then AWS appeared. The most accomplished developers on my teams have similar histories. Nothing wrong with loving a stack and sticking with it - but limiting your choices to only those with \u201cx years of experience in stack y\u201d, can prevent you from seeing a good number of excellent applicants. Flexible applicants with great communication skills should be favoured over \u201crock stars\u201d. Being able to pair with a business-focused team member to solution out a feature is much more important than being able to make the fanciest, most efficient widget. Consider the following comparison between two developers, one who is amazing at programming but poor at dealing with people or with change, and one who is middling in skill but excellent at dealing with people and taking feedback. Both are given a task that is estimated to take two weeks.  Amazing engineer finishes it in one week, and demos it to the lead. The feature has been implemented in a way that is incompatible with the solution architect\u2019s vision, which was alluded to in the ticket and mentioned in planning. The engineer goes back to the drawing board and takes the remaining week to complete the task according to the spec.  Middling skill engineer spends a day or two asking questions and understanding the underlying business requirements for the task. They take the remaining eight days to complete the task. Since they spent time asking questions and didn\u2019t get started until they fully understood the problem domain, their solution passed scrutiny. Both engineers finished their task in the same amount of time - the difference is the management and technical overhead required for each team member. As a manager, I want team members who proactively look to fill holes in their understanding of the underlying reasons for their work, and who raise flags early. I do not want team members who go silent for weeks and surface only with what they consider a \u201cfinished\u201d feature. Solution: Consider how to interview and screen for applicants who possess the interpersonal skills, flexibility and communication ability that make for a great team. Do not fall into the trap of hiring for technical ability alone. Interpersonal skills, flexibility and communication ability can be exposed with a surprisingly simple tip my current boss, Jean-Louis taught me: Spend the first 10-15 minutes of the interview generally chatting. Your discussion should aim to surface some strongly held technical opinions (e. g. Docker is bad, Azure is better than AWS, Go is better than Rust, whatever - you don\u2019t have to be an expert in it for this to work). Once you\u2019ve got your topic, turn the conversation back to it, positing that you strongly feel the opposite is true. Maintain this position. People with skills I claim here are desirable will argue with grace, no matter how unbelievable they find your position to be. People who don\u2019t have these skills \u2026 will act vastly differently. The idea is to simulate the type of interactions engineering teams should be experiencing frequently: the free exchange of ideas and suggestions without egos getting in the way. We want everyone on the team to feel comfortable expressing their opinions - if they\u2019re wrong, they learn why. If they\u2019re right, the company learns a better way. Understand that different genders and cultures view their position in hierarchy differently: Pay attention to what their experience tells you they can do, not what they apply for: Problems: Observations during hiring have shown me that people are vastly different in their opinions of their own position within professional hierarchies, and therefore how eligible they might be for open positions. Background: When advertising for multiple roles identical in everything but the expected level (and therefore pay), I\u2019ve found that women and people from cultures different to mine are more likely to apply for roles lower than what I argue they should be applying for. Solution: When faced with a situation where an applicant is clearly applying for a position below them, don\u2019t knowingly hire them into the lower role. If you have a higher level position available, at your earliest opportunity inform them that you very much appreciate them applying for the role they applied for, but you\u2019d be very interested in interviewing them for the higher role. I\u2019ve taken this approach with multiple hires. In some cases it took some convincing on my part to have them confidently proceed with the higher position, but in all cases they excelled at their new roles. Wrapping up this long but not exhaustive list: Go forth and build a diverse and inclusive team: Building a diverse and inclusive team is challenging, and takes more time than hiring according to decades-held traditional dogma. It\u2019s worth it: as with biology, a monoculture always loses in the end when competing with a mixed population - the same is true for technology teams. There are clear benefits to hiring and maintaining a diverse team, like doing the right thing most of the time and performing better than monocultures. The solutions to some problems I\u2019ve faced when hiring technical team members should help you restructure your recruitment strategy into one that favours applicant\u2019s who will take your organisation forward into the future, instead of entrenching habits from the past.
