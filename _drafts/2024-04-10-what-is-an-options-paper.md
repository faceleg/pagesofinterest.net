As organisations grow there is a shift from singleton decisions and responsibility to spreading of responsibility and decisions being reached often by influence and argument.

It is common in very large organisations to find that only a small handful of individuals can make decisions, and that even their decisions require sign-off from above before being enacted. This is especially true when it comes to decisions involving the spending of money, whether it is is spent by purchasing a product or service or the time of existing employees. These form part of a governance framework that makes up the checks & balances intended to prevent duplicate efforts, increased variance in the system and movements away from a strategic direction.

As uncomfortable as these hierarchical decision frameworks can be, when implemented and followed properly they can be the difference between aligning with strategy or not, meeting budget expectations or not, and generally staying in business. It can be amazing to see the waste generated by teams traveling towards their own goals with no regard for the organisation, with no constraints pulling them towards a common outcome.

When operating in this environment, usually as a manager, it is important to understand there three key facts:

1. The process exists to help the company succeed by enforcing alignment to strategy
2. The process is simple and effective if #1 is understood
3. "Winning" means understanding the above two points and combining this with influence and sales skills to achieve what you see as critical outcomes for your teams when contributing to the overall strategy.

## Enter the options paper

In the environment described above, you operate as a manger in a constrained environment. Whether you know your budgets or not, they exist. They exist in likely two forms, helpful to know if these constraints haven't been made explicitly clear you as you can use this information to estimate:

- Your available headcount.
- Your available money for goods or services (e.g. SaaS tools or vendor spend).

You are unlikely to have a surplus, which means if you find something you need, whether this is more people, a new tool or support from a third party, you will have to ask for money to achieve this.

This is where an options paper comes in.

A great options paper offers four major components:

1. A clear explanation of the problem (with a high level overview of the ideal solution)
2. A clear outline of the options available (usually no more than 3, 2 is better), with a clear winner
3. A blindingly obvious "so what" that outlines what happens if you _do not_ get what you are asking for

The fourth doesn't go into your options paper, it needs to be an understanding within yourself. You need to understand that you may not have all the available context and despite putting together a wonderful paper, still get denied. Be like your team and separate your emotions from this work. If you fail, understand why and possibly try again, don't let it beat you down.

The paper should be no more than 4-5 pages long (including graphs if necessary) if written, and no more than 4 slides if assembled in presentation style. Personally I prefer written papers but you will need to follow norms within your organisation here.

### 1. Clear explanation of the problem

### 2. Clear outline of options available

### 3. So what?

## Think of the audience

## Design matters

## Politics and pre-sign off, shopping it around

## Nothing is perfect, learn and iterate
