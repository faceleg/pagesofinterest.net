Whether by your action or not, your teams are constrained. Understanding their constraints allows a leader more tools to direct attention and effort where it counts.

Many Software engineers are incentivised towards "newness".

The industry can be perceived as rewarding those who create impactful shared code, or even rewarding those who work with the latest tech.

This is harmful to stable, successful teams looking to iterate their offerings within established industries where innovation can be easily achieved with "boring" tech done well; where product lifecycles extend into years or decades.

If you find yourself leading teams in one of these organsations, consider constraints.
