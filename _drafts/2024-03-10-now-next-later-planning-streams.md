Leaders need to show plans and progress up and down the chain. Using the now, next, later format helps gather ideas and works well to display high level detail.

Especially as a new leader, showing teams a vision, aligning this to a strategy and helping them achieve visible progress towards strategic goals in a quarter or so are critical actions. This tool is also an excellent way to confirm your understanding of what is being worked on, what is next up and what the may be coming next. It works from one team up to whole organisations.

The Now, Next, Later data aggregation, planning and display framework is great in these situations. Created by [Janna Bastow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jannabastow/?originalSubdomain=uk), it is flexible, quick to teach and easy to keep up to date. Janna suggests using it instead of traditional roadmaps and if you work for a company that allows this, great. If not it is still useful as a discovery and display tool as you work out exactly work from which teams need to go into what roadmap.

Fundamentally the now, next, later roadmap consists of three columns showing work across three time horizons.

1. Now: things being worked on now
2. Next: things in plan/ready to work on next
3. Later: things that might be a good idea to do in the future

It's that simple. Any ticket-based management software (MS Whiteboard, ProdPad, MIRO) can accommodate it, failing that use excel or a physical board and post-its. Janna goes into great detail in her post [Why Janna Invented the Now-Next-Later Roadmap](https://www.prodpad.com/blog/invented-now-next-later-roadmap/).

The combination of freedom and constraints make this tool excellent in group sessions and will build out to a solid base for your next step, whether that's refining what's next or digging into multiple streams to produce a formal, standard roadmap.
